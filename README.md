Buy Sell Ink is a simple game written in C for fun and to learn programming. 
It is a game about buying and selling items to customers, with the goal of getting the best score at the end.

How it works:

Customers request an item and offer you gold for it.  

Have it? You can accept this deal or try to negotiate a better price.  

If you are successful at negotiating you get 2 points. Lose the negotiation however and lose a point. Accepting the deal without negotiating awards 1 point.  

Don't have it? Buy it. You buy items at half the price.  


But be careful! Items 7-9 (Ink, Weed and Crypto) are illegal! Sell them and the police will get suspicious. If you keep it up you might get arrested and give a hefty fine, unless...  

Illegal items are very negotiable in their price making them much more profitable. Sometimes they may be worth the risk.  


The game ends after your selected number of turns expires and you get a score. Try to get the best score possible!   

The game could also end if you are out of money. You get 1 turn to try and sell your inventory if that's the case, otherwise game over!  


The game can simply be compiled with gcc "gcc main.c" and is played on the terminal.
